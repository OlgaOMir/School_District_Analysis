# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 

## Summary

The purpose of this analysis was to review the city school distric data and provide some insight on the student performance on the reading and math tests. The primary goal was to provide an insign on the top and bottom performing schools adn identify ay patterns. I believe it would be worthwhile to look at the test performance campared to the school budget and see if the top performing schools have larger budgets.
